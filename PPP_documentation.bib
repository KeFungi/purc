@article{Groeneveld:2010,
	Abstract = {Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot, well known for its endemic primates, the lemurs. Numbers of recognized lemur species have increased drastically in some genera (e.g. Microcebus), while field-based studies revealed low species diversity in the dwarf lemurs (genus Cheirogaleus). Only three (C. medius, C. major, C. crossleyi) of seven described species have to date been identified in field-based studies. Blanco et al. (2009) reported two sympatric Cheirogaleus species at Tsinjoarivo based on morphological data, one of which they attributed to C. crossleyi and the other of which they described as C. sibreei-like, or possibly a new species. Based on comparative analyses of mtDNA (cytb) and nDNA (vWF, fiba, adora3), we confirm the presence of C. crossleyi and show that the C. sibreei-like individuals form a well-defined fourth clade, basal to the three recognized species. Whereas these molecular analyses demonstrate that a non-holotype museum specimen considered by Groves (2000) to belong to C. sibreei does not cluster with the C. sibreei-like individuals from Tsinjoarivo, morphometric analysis of one Tsinjoarivo individual, the C. sibreei holotype from Ankeramadinika, and samples of C. medius, C. major, and C. crossleyi strongly suggests that the fourth (and basal) clade is indeed C. sibreei. Tsinjoarivo therefore becomes the only known field site harboring C. sibreei today. Given ongoing forest loss and fragmentation at Tsinjoarivo we can surmise that this population, critical to our understanding of the evolution of the genus Cheirogaleus, is also critically endangered.},

	Abstract = {This study uses traditional and contemporary phylogenetic and population genetic analyses to assess the causes of discordance (i.e., lineage sorting and introgression) among mitochondrial and nuclear gene trees for a clade of eastern North American scarab beetles (fraterna species group, genus Phyllophaga). I estimated gene trees using individual and combined analysis of one mitochondrial and two nuclear loci in MrBayes, and inferred a species tree using a hierarchical coalescent approach based on all loci in the program Best. Because hybridization violates the assumptions of BEST, I tested for introgression by comparing species monophyly between the mitochondrial and nuclear gene trees based on the prediction that cytoplasmic genomes introgress more readily than nuclear genomes. Haplotype exclusivity was identified using Bayesian tests of monophyly and the genealogical sorting index. I used the results of the phylogenetic analyses and monophyly tests to develop an explicit hypothesis of introgression that could be tested in the program IMa. Results from these analyses provided evidence for introgression across clades within the fraterna group. The tiered analytical approach used in this study demonstrated how the use of multiple methods can identify when assumptions are violated and methods are prone to yield misleading results.},

@article{Sakalidis:2011,
	Abstract = {Neofusicoccum is a recently described genus of common endophytes and pathogens of woody hosts, previously placed in the genus Botryosphaeria. Many morphological characteristics routinely used to describe species overlap in Neofusicoccum, and prior to the use of molecular phylogenetics, isolates from different hosts and locations were often misidentified. Two cryptic species Neofusicoccum ribis and Neofusicoccum parvum were initially described from different continents and recently another four species within this complex were described using fixed nucleotide polymorphisms for differentiation. In a survey of eucalypt cankers in eastern Australia, a collection of morphologically similar Neofusicoccum isolates were obtained. This collection was analysed within the framework of the morphological (MSRC), ecological (ESRC) and phylogenetic (PSRC) species recognition concepts. Morphological data based on spore measurements (MSRC), together with pathogenicity trials (ESRC) were considered alongside molecular analysis (PSRC), which included multiple gene phylogenies constructed from four nuclear gene regions. We also used the Genealogical Sorting Index method to provide objective evidence for the status of terminal taxa in the phylogenetic analysis. The isolates examined exhibited overlapping morphological and culture characteristics, similar pathogenicity to excised stems and shared hosts within the same locations. Phylogenetic analysis separated isolates into 8 clades corresponding to six described species: N. ribis, N. parvum, Neofusicoccum kwambonambiense, Neofusicoccum cordaticola, Neofusicoccum umdonicola, Neofusicoccum batangarum, and two new species. GSI support indicated combined phylogenetic data were monophyletic for all clades and all p-values were significant allowing us to reject the null hypothesis that all groups were from a single mixed group. Consequently the description of Neofusicoccum occulatum is presented.},

@article{Venditti:2008,
	Abstract = {We investigate the performance of phylogenetic mixture models in reducing a well-known and pervasive artifact of phylogenetic inference known as the node-density effect, comparing them to partitioned analyses of the same data. The node-density effect refers to the tendency for the amount of evolutionary change in longer branches of phylogenies to be underestimated compared to that in regions of the tree where there are more nodes and thus branches are typically shorter. Mixture models allow more than one model of sequence evolution to describe the sites in an alignment without prior knowledge of the evolutionary processes that characterize the data or how they correspond to different sites. If multiple evolutionary patterns are common in sequence evolution, mixture models may be capable of reducing node-density effects by characterizing the evolutionary processes more accurately. In gene-sequence alignments simulated to have heterogeneous patterns of evolution, we find that mixture models can reduce node-density effects to negligible levels or remove them altogether, performing as well as partitioned analyses based on the known simulated patterns. The mixture models achieve this without knowledge of the patterns that generated the data and even in some cases without specifying the full or true model of sequence evolution known to underlie the data. The latter result is especially important in real applications, as the true model of evolution is seldom known. We find the same patterns of results for two real data sets with evidence of complex patterns of sequence evolution: mixture models substantially reduced node-density effects and returned better likelihoods compared to partitioning models specifically fitted to these data. We suggest that the presence of more than one pattern of evolution in the data is a common source of error in phylogenetic inference and that mixture models can often detect these patterns even without prior knowledge of their presence in the data. Routine use of mixture models alongside other approaches to phylogenetic inference may often reveal hidden or unexpected patterns of sequence evolution and can improve phylogenetic inference.},
